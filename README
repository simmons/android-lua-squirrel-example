Android Lua and Squirrel Examples
======================================================================

This package contains simple "Hello, World" demonstrations for
embedding the Lua and Squirrel languages into Android apps.  No
inter-language glue is provided, other than the minimum JNI code to
call the embedded language from Java.

Building the examples
--------------------------------------------------

1. Install Eclipse and Google's Android Development Tools (ADT)
   for Eclipse.

2. Set up a fresh Eclipse workspace with the following settings which
   can be configured in the preferences:
    a. Under Java->Compiler,
       - set the Java compliance level to "1.6",
       - uncheck "Use default compliance settings", and
       - make sure "Generated .class files compatibility" and "Source
         compatibility" are set to "1.6".
    b. Under Android, set up your Android SDK directory and target.
       I use the "Android 2.1-update1" target for Valence.

3. Add the projects:
    a. File->Import...->General->Existing Projects into Workspace.
    b. Select the directory that contains these two projects.
    c. A list of the projects will appear.  Select each project.
    d. Leave "Copy projects into workspace" and "Add project to working
       sets" unchecked.
    e. "Finish".

The projects will initially appear with many errors flagged, as
Eclipse and the ADT perform the build tasks, but should settle in a
bit.  If not, it sometimes helps to close the project (right-click on
the project name and click "Close Project") and re-open it, which
forces ADT to regenerate certain files.

Run "ndk-build" from each project's jni directory to compile the
shared libraries.


Credit
--------------------------------------------------

The lua-example project was based on the android-lua project, which
shows how to integrate Lua into an Android app.  The android-lua
project maintainer also tweaked a few lines of the Lua source
to allow compilation for Android.
